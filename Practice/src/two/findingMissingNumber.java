   Bit Manipulation 
 * Intuition
 * We can harness the fact that XOR is its own inverse to find the missing element in linear time.
 * Algorithm
 * Because we know that nums contains n numbers and that 
 * it is missing exactly one number on the range [0..nâˆ’1], 
 * we know that n definitely replaces the missing number in nums. 
 * Therefore, if we initialize an integer to n and XOR it with every index and value, 
 * we will be left with the missing number.
